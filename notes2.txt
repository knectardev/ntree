> Yellow line 1 minute resolution issues

Why this is especially confusing in your UI

Because:

The yellow line is not price

It is not computed at the candle resolution

But it looks like it’s tied to the candle selector

So users (correctly!) infer a contradiction.

What you should do to fix this (UX + correctness)
✅ 1. Decouple cleaned-signal rendering from candle size

For the cleaned signal panel only:

Always render at native 1-minute resolution

Do not downsample to match candle size

Let it “float” over the price view

This makes the line visually stable across candle selections.

Price candles can change.
Analysis overlays should not.

✅ 2. Add a small, explicit label (this matters)

Right near the cleaned signal title, add:

Rendered at full 1-minute resolution

or

Independent of candle display

This instantly resolves user confusion.

✅ 3. (Optional but strong) Lock the cleaned signal’s Y-scale

If you normalize the cleaned signal to:

±1

or recent RMS

and keep that scale fixed, then:

amplitude comparisons become meaningful

visual shape becomes more consistent across views
