Can you create the following: 
* an SQLLite database
* python based application framework 
* a script that ingests stock ticker data for SPY and QQQ, and stores this in the database. The script should store 1 minute and 5 minute data for each going back 24 hours. 
* web page that displays a grid that has columns for the tickers (just SPY and QQQ for now), and a column the latest price that has been stored in the database for each ticker, a time-stamp for each. Each row in the grid should be clickable, and when clicked, should open up a detail view for that ticker. 
* On the detail view, there should be a custom chart that displays all of the ticker data for 1 minute, and a link to switch to the five minute view. 

Once this foundation is in place, we can proceed with refinements.
