# DO NOT USE WORKTREES

**The main project path is:** `c:\local_dev\ntree`

**NEVER** edit files under:
- `C:\Users\chris\.cursor\worktrees\ntree\*`
- Any path containing `worktrees\ntree\` (e.g. wrn, uso, cpe, ooo)

All code changes must be made in the main project at `c:\local_dev\ntree`. Ignore workspace path if it points to a worktree.
