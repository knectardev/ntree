To achieve a convincing slide guitar sound in your MIDI application, you need to simulate the physical behavior of a slide moving across strings. Standard MIDI notes are too discrete; slide guitar relies on continuous pitch movement and specific phrasing.

Based on the `conductor.js` logic, here are the three primary areas where you can improve the "slide" feel:

### 1. Implement Portamento (Pitch Gliding)

In your `processSubStep` function, when `sopranoMidi` changes, the audio shouldn't just jump to the next frequency. A slide player physically slides the metal or glass bar between notes.

* **Continuous Glide:** Instead of just triggering a new note, use the `portamento` setting in your Tone.js Sampler or Synth. This creates a linear frequency ramp between notes.
* **Variable Slide Speed:** In your `applySlurDurationScale` function, you already have logic for "legato" phrasing. You can link the `portamento` time to the `distance` between notes:
```javascript
// Concept for your play note function
const distance = Math.abs(currentMidi - lastMidi);
const glideTime = distance * 0.05; // 50ms per semitone
sampler.triggerAttack(newNote, time, { portamento: glideTime });

```



### 2. Micro-tonality and "Overshoot"

Slide players rarely land perfectly on the center of a pitch instantly. They often "scoop" into a note from below or vibrate around it.

* **The "Scoop":** Modify your `executeSopranoRunStep` to occasionally trigger a note 10–20 cents flat and then quickly automate the `detune` or `pitchBend` up to the target.
* **Vibrato:** Slide vibrato is wider and slower than finger vibrato. You can use an LFO on the pitch, but for a "slide" feel, it’s often better to automate the pitch bend manually in a "shaking" pattern once a note is held.

### 3. Phrasing: Slurs and Ties

Your code already contains a `shouldTieNote` function that checks for `slurAmount`. To make this sound like a slide:

* **Avoid Re-triggering:** If `shouldTieNote` returns true, do **not** call `triggerAttack`. Instead, only update the frequency of the currently playing oscillator. This prevents the "pluck" sound of a new pick attack, which is essential because a slide player often plucks once and slides through several notes.
* **Wick-Hugging Phrasing:** Since your app uses price data (upper/lower wicks) to drive the melody, ensure that the "slide" effect is most prominent when the price is moving rapidly. You can scale the `slurAmount` or `portamento` depth based on the "Price Delta" to make the guitar sound more aggressive during high volatility.

### Recommended Signal Chain

If you are using Tone.js (as suggested by the `Tone.now()` calls in your code), adding these effects will help:

1. **Sampler:** Use a high-quality "clean electric" sample set.
2. **Chorus/Vibrato:** To simulate the slight pitch instability of the slide.
3. **Amp Simulator:** A bit of "crunch" or overdrive hides the artificiality of MIDI transitions and adds the sustain necessary for long slides.
