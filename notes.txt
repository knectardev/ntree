R-like coefficient for how well the sine wave fits the selected rhythm

Part 1. 

Pearson correlation between the detrended signal and the fitted sine wave

If:

x(t) = cleaned signal

s(t) = best-fit sine at the selected period

Then:

r = corr(x, s)


Properties:

Range: –1 to +1

Directly interpretable

Very familiar to users

Sign tells phase alignment, magnitude tells strength

UI label:

Sine fit correlation: r = 0.63

This is the closest thing to an “R coefficient.”




Add these lines to the Insight Summary:

Pearson Sine fit correlation: r = 0.62
Explained motion: 38% of cleaned signal
