Short answer: yes, it’s possible to use the main price chart—but only if you’re very deliberate about what you’re overlaying and how. Otherwise it quickly becomes apples-and-oranges and cognitively misleading.

Here’s a clean way to think about it.

The core issue: unit mismatch, not legitimacy

The problem isn’t philosophical, it’s dimensional:

Price chart → dollars (or log-dollars)

Strategy performance → portfolio value / returns / equity curve

Overlaying raw equity value on raw price without normalization is genuinely misleading.

That’s why most platforms default to a separate performance pane.

But there are legitimate patterns that work.

Patterns that do work on the main price chart
1. Normalized / indexed equity curve overlay (✓ recommended)

This is the cleanest “single chart” solution.

How it works

Normalize both series to a common base (e.g. 100 at start)

Plot:

SPY indexed to 100

Strategy equity indexed to 100

Why it works

Same units: relative growth

Direct visual comparison of:

Drawdowns

Relative momentum

Regime divergence

How it’s usually labeled

“Indexed performance”

“Growth of $1”

“Rebased to 100”

This is not apples vs oranges anymore—it’s apples vs applesauce.

Many institutional tools quietly do this even when the UI looks like “price.”

2. Relative performance (alpha) line

Instead of plotting the strategy itself:

Alpha
(
𝑡
)
=
Strategy
(
𝑡
)
Benchmark
(
𝑡
)
Alpha(t)=
Benchmark(t)
Strategy(t)
	​


or log-difference.

Use cases

Emphasizes when you’re adding value

Makes regime sensitivity very obvious

Avoids absolute scale entirely

UX pattern

Thin line overlaid on price

Or faint background ribbon (green = outperforming, red = underperforming)

This works extremely well visually and cognitively.

3. Position-aware price chart (not equity-aware)

Another very common pro approach:

Keep the main chart as price only

Overlay:

Long/short regimes (background shading)

Entry / exit markers

Stop / TP hits

Exposure intensity (opacity or band thickness)

Here, the chart answers:

“How did the strategy behave relative to price?”

The equity curve answers:

“Did this behavior make money?”

This separation is intentional and healthy.

Patterns that usually fail (or confuse)
❌ Raw equity value over price

Different units

Implied causality that isn’t real

Breaks instantly if leverage or cash is involved

❌ Dual y-axes (price left, equity right)

This looks OK but is cognitively dangerous:

Human eye assumes correlation

Scale choices can make anything “look good”

Many quant teams explicitly ban this in internal tools.

A useful mental model for ntree

Think in three semantic layers, even if rendered together:

1. Market reality

Price

Volume

VWAP

Volatility

2. Strategy intent

Regime (long / short / flat)

Signal confidence

Stops / targets

Risk state

3. Outcome

Equity curve

Drawdown

Returns distribution

You can render layers 1 + 2 on the same chart.
Layer 3 should usually be derived, not overlaid raw.

A strong hybrid UI pattern (what I’d recommend for you)

Main chart

Price (possibly log scale)

Regime shading

Entries / exits

Stop / TP markers

Optional: indexed benchmark line (faint)

Secondary but visually aligned pane

Indexed strategy equity

Drawdown area (inverted)

Exposure over time (thin bars)

This keeps causality honest:

Price explains decisions

Decisions explain equity

Bottom line

Yes, you can use the main price chart

Only if you normalize or express relative performance

Raw equity ≠ price (that’s the real apples/oranges problem)

The best systems separate behavior visualization from outcome visualization, even when they share an x-axis

If you want, next step could be:

A concrete spec for “Indexed Performance Overlay Mode” in ntree

Or a decision tree: when to show equity vs when to hide it based on audience (research vs presentation vs live trading)

Just say which direction you want to go.
