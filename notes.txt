Yes — this section is doing something important, but right now it’s written in a way that only makes sense if you already understand the internals. This is a classic case where renaming + a single good tooltip will dramatically improve comprehension.

I’ll give you:

A better section name

Plain-English replacements for the labels

One clear tooltip that explains the whole thing at once

(Optional) a micro-legend that makes it readable at a glance

1. Better section name (most important)
Current

Consistency

This is vague and abstract.

Recommended

Rhythm stability over time

or, slightly shorter:

Rhythm stability

This immediately tells the user:

we are checking the same rhythm

across time

for reliability

2. Rename the internal labels (without changing the math)
Current line

Stability • dominant: 14m • dominance: 56% • flips: 1

Recommended rewrite

Most common rhythm: 14m
Agreement: 56%
Changes detected: 1

Each term maps cleanly to what you already compute:

Old term	New term	Why
dominant	Most common rhythm	“Dominant” sounds political/technical
dominance	Agreement	Humans instantly get “agreement”
flips	Changes detected	Explains what a “flip” means
Current second line

median separation: 1.04 • median resid σ: 0.450

Recommended rewrite

Clarity vs alternatives: 1.04×
Typical noise level: 0.45

This keeps accuracy but removes jargon:

“separation” → “clarity”

“resid σ” → “noise level”

3. One explanatory tooltip that explains the entire section

This is the key part.

Tooltip title

How rhythm stability is measured

Tooltip body (suggested text)

This checks whether the same rhythm keeps winning over time.

We repeatedly re-run the Pattern Finder on overlapping recent windows and track:

• Agreement — how often the same rhythm wins
• Clarity — how much better it is than the runner-up
• Changes — how often a different rhythm takes over

Stable rhythms show high agreement, clear separation, and few changes.
Unstable or noisy markets cause frequent changes and low agreement.

This tooltip:

explains why this exists

explains how it works

explains how to interpret it

does not require math knowledge

4. Make the bar visualization self-explanatory (small tweak)

Right now:

▓▓▓▓▓▓ recent windows →

That’s not obvious to a non-technical user.

Recommended micro-label

Change to:

Agreement across recent windows →

Or even:

How often this rhythm repeats consistently →

That one phrase makes the bars readable without explanation.

Optional: a one-line verdict (very effective)

Under the section header, add a short sentence that updates dynamically:

🟢 Rhythm is stable over time

🟡 Rhythm appears intermittently

🔴 Rhythm is inconsistent

This mirrors the Insight Summary and reinforces the mental model.

Final “clean” version (how it would read)

Rhythm stability

Most common rhythm: 14m
Agreement: 56%  Changes detected: 1
Clarity vs alternatives: 1.04×  Typical noise level: 0.45

▓▓▓▓▓▓ Agreement across recent windows →

Tooltip: (as written above)

Why this works

Uses plain language

Explains intent, not mechanics

Matches the mental model you’re building elsewhere (“rhythm”, “agreement”, “clarity”)

Keeps the tool powerful without intimidating users

If you want, next I can:

help you align the numeric thresholds with words like Low / Medium / High, or

rewrite the Insight Summary text so it reuses the same vocabulary for consistency across the UI.
