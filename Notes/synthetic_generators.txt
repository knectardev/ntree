Clarify “midprice” naming

Right now:

midprice = price_close


so midprice is really “use close as our central reference.”
That’s fine as a simplification, but if you want a true mid:

midprice = price_close  # current code
# or more literal:
# midprice = price_close  # in synthetic world, treat close as proxy for mid


Maybe just add a comment like:

# In this synthetic model, treat close as mid for simplicity.


Or, if you want to be pedantic:

midprice = price_close  # placeholder; in a real L2 feed this would be (best_bid + best_ask)/2


Use random.Random(seed) instead of global seed (optional)

If you eventually want multiple independent generators running in the same process, it can be cleaner to do:

rng = random.Random(seed) if seed is not None else random

# then use rng.gauss, rng.uniform, rng.random instead of random.*


But your current approach is fine for now.

Type alias for regimes (purely cosmetic)

If you want more explicitness:

from typing import Literal

Regime = Literal["UP", "DOWN", "CHOP"]
current_regime: Regime = "CHOP"
